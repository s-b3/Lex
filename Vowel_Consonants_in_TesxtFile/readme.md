This program is designed to analyze the content of a text file, identifying and counting the occurrences of vowels, consonants, and blank spaces. 
It utilizes a lexical analyzer generated by Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) to parse through the input file character by character, categorizing each character accordingly.
After execution, the program prints the total counts of vowels, consonants, and blank spaces to the console.
Additionally, it generates two output files, "vowels.txt" and "consonants.txt", containing the respective characters identified from the input text file.
